# Create picture thumbnails

The Internet is all about speed. The faster your page loads, the less likely people are to click away. And we want people to stick around to share our great ideas with our ideas app! Also, people with data plans visiting your website will thank you for requiring less data to be transmitted.

One way to speed up page loads is by displaying images in a smaller size. The smaller an image is, the fast it will be transmitted over the Internet.

## Install ImageMagick

We'll be using the ImageMagick tool to resize the pictures uploaded to your ideas.

<div class="os-specific">
  <div class="mac">
    <p>Run the following command in the Terminal app:</p>
{% highlight sh %}
brew install imagemagick
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
  <div class="nix">
    <p>If you are on Ubuntu, run the following command in the Terminal app:</p>
{% highlight sh %}
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y imagemagick
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
  <div class="win">
    <p>Download and run the <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows">ImageMagick installer</a> (use the first <em>download</em> link). In the installation wizard, make sure you check the checkbox to install legacy utilities.</p>
  </div>
</div>

{% coach %}
Explain what is ImageMagick and how is it different from libraries/gems we used before?
{% endcoach %}

## Install a Ruby gem for ImageMagick

For Ruby to talk with ImageMagick, we'll be using the `mini_magick` Ruby gem. First we will need to add it to our app and install it.

Open `Gemfile` in your Text Editor and add this line:

{% highlight ruby %}
gem "mini_magick"
{% endhighlight %}

below the line:

{% highlight ruby %}
gem "carrierwave"
{% endhighlight %}

In the Terminal app run this command:

{% highlight sh %}
bundle install
{% endhighlight %}

Make sure to (re)start your Rails server after installation.

## Tell your app to create thumbnails

Now that we have a way to talk to ImageMagick through the `mini_magick` Ruby gem, we can tell the file upload gem `carrierwave` to create thumbnails for every picture you upload.

Open `app/uploaders/picture_uploader.rb` and find the line that looks like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
# include CarrierWave::MiniMagick
{% endhighlight %}

Remove the `#` sign at the front of the line.

{% coach %}
Explain the concept of comments in code.
{% endcoach %}

Below the line you just changed, add these lines:

{% highlight ruby %}
version :thumb do
  process :resize_to_fit => [150, 150]
end
{% endhighlight %}

The images uploaded from now on will be resized to a smaller size, but the ones we already have haven't been updated. Instead, let's edit an idea and add a new picture. When saved the idea now has a thumbnail for the uploaded picture.

## Display the thumbnail

We haven't changed how the idea pictures are displayed, so it should still be showing the original larger image. Let's change the views to display the thumbnail instead.

Open `app/views/ideas/index.html.erb` and change the line:

{% highlight erb %}
<%= image_tag(@idea.picture_url, width: 150, height: 150, class: "img-thumbnail flex-shrink-0") if @idea.picture? %>
{% endhighlight %}

to this line:

{% highlight erb %}
<%= image_tag(@idea.picture_url(:thumb), width: 150, height: 150, class: "img-thumbnail flex-shrink-0") if @idea.picture? %>
{% endhighlight %}

Take a look at the [list of ideas](http://localhost:3000/ideas) in the Browser to see if your ideas now have a thumbnail.

{% coach %}
Explain what specifying the image width in HTML and how it differs from resizing images on the server. Both images may look small, but only one is resized as a thumbnail.
{% endcoach %}
